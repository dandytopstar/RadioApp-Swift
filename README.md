## Creating an App

If you create an app with the code, or interesting project inspired by the code, shoot me an email. I love hearing about your projects!

This is just a basic template. You may use it as a clean starting point to add other features.

Some of the things I've built into this Radio code for clients include: Facebook login, Profiles, Saving Favorite Tracks, Playlists, Genres, Spotify integration, Enhanced Streaming, Tempo Analyzing, etc. There's almost unlimited things you can use this code as a starting place for. I keep this repo lightweight. That way you can customize it easily. 

## Setup

The "Config.swift" file contains some project configs to get you started.
Watch this [Getting Started Video](https://youtu.be/m7jiajCHFvc) to get up & running quickly.
